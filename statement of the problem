Kshitij has recently started solving problems on codechef. As he is real problem solving enthusiast, he wants continuous growth in number of problems solved per day. He started with a problems on first day.

He solves d problems more than previous day. But after every k days , he increases d by inc .

Can you guess how many questions he will solve on nth day ?

Input:
First line contains T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single line of input,five integers a,d,k,n,inc.
Output:
For each testcase, output in a single line number of questions solved on nth day.

Constraints
1≤T≤15
1≤a≤99
1≤d≤100
1≤n≤10000
1≤k≤n
0≤inc≤99
Sample Input:
1
1 4 3 8 2
Sample Output:
43
EXPLANATION:
The number of questions solved in first 8 days is :

1 5 9 15 21 27 35 43 .

On first day he solved 1 problem . Here d is 4 for first 3 days. Then after 3 days d increases by 2 (that is 6).
